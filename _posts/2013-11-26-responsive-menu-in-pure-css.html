Having menus that gracefully adapt to the size of your screen can be troublesome. Inspired by the collapsible menu of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, here is a pure CSS implementation using the checkbox trick to toggle visibility.<br />
<br />
The example attached features a smaller menu when the screen is narrower than 900px and is collapsed then narrower than 650px. I encourage you to test whatever suits you best.<br />
<br />
On collapse toggle, the height and visibility are animated for a smooth transition. <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">height: auto;</span> is not directly supported, so we instead animate the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">max-height</span> property. The downside is that you need to specify the max-height your menu will ever have. If you set this too high, you will experience a slight graphic glitch.<br />
<br />
The toggle handle is also inspired from Bootstrap, but with minimal markup.<br />
<br />
* the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">:checked</span> selector is not supported prior to IE9, you may use a polyfill like&nbsp;http://selectivizr.com/ if you need to.<br />
<br />
Happy coding !<br />
