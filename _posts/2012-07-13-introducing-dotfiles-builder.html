<h2>
  Managing bashrc sucks
</h2>
<p>
  We all have our nice little bashrc that we are proud of.
  It tests for files, programs and terminal features, detect your OS version,
  builds a PATH, etc.
  For all of our OS and different setups, various solutions exist.
</p>
<h3>
  Keeping several versions
</h3>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ultimate fine-tuning</li>
  <li>Easy to understand</li>
  <li>Usually optimized for every setup</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very time consuming to manage</li>
  <li>Hard to “backport” new ideas</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Keep a single unusable file with everything and edit accordingly
</h3>
<p>
  Pros:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to backport, you just need to rembember to do it</li>
  <li>Good performance</li>
  <li>Since you edit at each deployment, nice fine-tuning capability</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The single file can become unbearably cluttered.</li>
  <li>You eventually end up managing several version.</li>
  <li>Tedious to edit at each deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3>
  Include several subfiles
</h3>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Still have a lot fine-tuning capabilities</li>
  <li>If well constructed, can be easy to understand</li>
  <li>Easy to deploy new features</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hard to detect which file to include</li>
  <li>Multiplicates the number of files to manage</li>
  <li>Slow performance</li>
  <li>Until recently, this was my prefered method.</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Wanted features
</h2>
<p>So, what does a good bashrc have?</p>
<p>Should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good performance. On a busy server, you really don't want to wait 5 seconds for your new terminal because your IO is sky rocketing.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce number of included files</li>
    <li>Reduce tests for environment features</li>
    <li>Reduce tests for program and files</li>
  </ul>
  <li>High flexibility</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Cross-OS compatible</li>
    <li>A lot of feature detection</li>
    <li>Ideally, configuration files</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Ease and speed of configuration</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It should not take more than a minute to setup a new bashrc</li>
    <li>If you need to specify your developer email, it would be nice to do it only once.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
  Yes, you read right, reduce tests AND do a lot of feature detection.
  You don't want to do Java specific configuration or set an empty variable if Java is not even installed,
  but you <em>do</em> want Java to be automatically detected.
</p>

<h2>
  Generating a bashrc
</h2>
<p>
  Let's face it, you will install or remove Java way less often then you will start a new shell. Why then test for Java at each new shell?
</p>
<p>
  This is where I introduce the Dotfiles Builder. The script runs in Bash and outputs the wanted bashrc.
</p>

<p>
  This way, instead of doing:
</p>
{% highlight bash %}
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ]; then
  PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You would do:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ]; then
  echo "PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\""
fi
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And the result would simply be:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
{% endhighlight %}

<p>But constructing PATH is a rather common task and you want to make sure the folder is not already on your PATH. Why not wrap it up ?</p>

<p>
  Take a look at the alpha version:
  <a href="https://github.com/lavoiesl/dotfiles-builder/">https://github.com/lavoiesl/dotfiles-builder/</a>
  <br />
  As well as the <a href="https://github.com/lavoiesl/dotfiles-builder/blob/master/examples/.bashrc">example output</a>.
</p>

<p>
  This is a very alpha version of the intended program,
  but I still want to share what I have and maybe get some feedback and collaborators along the way.
  Currently, it only generates a bashrc, but expect more to come.
