PHP has no built-in base URL variable. In all the mess that is the $_SERVER variable, there is nothing that will tell you the base URL for your website. &nbsp;This is very useful when embedding assets and building URLs.<br />
<br />
The thing is you can start from the DOCUMENT_ROOT and work your way from there, but if you are using Apache’s <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html" target="_blank">VirtualDocumentRoot</a>, it is not reliable. Hence, you need to guess it.<br />
<br />
The trick resides in SCRIPT_NAME and SCRIPT_FILENAME that respectively describe the executed PHP file, starting from the domain, and its full path. I used exclamation marks as delimiters as I doubt you have some in your folder names. If you do, then… shame on you.<br />
<br />
While I was at it, I added some port and https detection and the absolute URL.<br />

<ol>
<li>Port detection of a server running behind a proxy. You may want to use the port of the proxy, not the Web server.</li>
<li>Same goes for https.</li>
<li>Non-resolved symlinks and relative paths. You may want to throw a couple of <a href="http://php.net/realpath" target="_blank">realpath()</a>&nbsp;in there.</li>
