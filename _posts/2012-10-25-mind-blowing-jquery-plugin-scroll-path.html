<a href="http://joelb.me/" target="_blank">Joel Besada</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBesada" target="_blank">@JoelBesada</a>) did a jQuery plugin that lets you define custom scroll paths, including rotations and custom scrollbars.<br />
<div>
<br /></div>

The technology is not very new, a lot of video presentations use this kind of stuff. However, he did a dead-simple implementation, available on <a href="https://github.com/JoelBesada/scrollpath" target="_blank">GitHub</a>&nbsp;which allows us to do it directly in the browser.<br />
<br />
The result is stunning; it is smooth, mostly compatible and pretty flexible. This is a wonderful alternative to building a PowerPoint to show your ideas.<br />
<br />
I have not used it yet, but it seems pretty easy. Check out the <a href="http://joelb.me/scrollpath" target="_blank">live demo</a>!</div>
