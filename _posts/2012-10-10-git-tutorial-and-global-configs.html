I was searching for inspiration for a good Git tutorial and I stumbled across a wonderful resource.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can take a week off and read the official <a href="http://git-scm.com/book" target="_blank">Git Book</a>&nbsp;but I wanted to give a crash course where I work so it was a bit lengthy. Don’t get me wrong, the Git Book is wonderfully written and anyone serious about Git should read it at least diagonally. However, if you don’t feel it at the moment, head over at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/Git/article.html" target="_blank">http://www.vogella.com/articles/Git/article.html</a><br />
<br />
Also, here is my setup for gitconfig and gitignore. Just copy gitignore to /etc/gitignore – or ~/.gitignore and change the corresponding path.<br />
