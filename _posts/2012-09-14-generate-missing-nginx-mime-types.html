Nginx comes with a rather small set of mime types compared to a default Linux system<br />
<br />
Linux uses a glob pattern to match a filename while Nginx matches only extension, but we can still use every glob in the format of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">*.ext</span><br />
<br />
So here is a small PHP script converting/sorting/filtering/formatting everything in a nice output.<br />
