CMS often come with a .htaccess that has a RewriteRule like this:<br />
<br />
{% highlight apache %}
# RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ app.php [QSA,L]
{% endhighlight %}
<br />
The RewriteBase has to be enabled if you are using a <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_vhost_alias.html#virtualdocumentroot">VirtualDocumentRoot</a>&nbsp;but when you are sharing code, developers may all have different setups.<br />
<br />
By checking the content of DOCUMENT_ROOT, we can guess which setup we are using and prepend a / when necessary.<br />
<br />
Note however that this method is heavy on string comparison which is slow and should not go on production.<br />
