As highligthed by&nbsp;<a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/07/30/when-a-blank-online-ad-gets-as-many-click-as-the-average-ad/" target="_blank">MacLeans</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thearf.org/news.php?newsid=278" target="_blank">Advertising Research Foundation</a>&nbsp;did an experiment showing that:<br />
<blockquote>
A blank banner ad received more clicks than the average Facebook ad, twice as many as your average “branded” display ad (a static ad which promotes a brand rather than a specific offer or call to action), and only one click in ten thousand less than the average banner ad.</blockquote>
While we all hate advertising when browsing, it provides nice revenues and is often how a website is able to live.<br />
<br />
What the ARF shows us is that the companies paying for advertising may be paying for air or, what is more likely to be true, inflated data.<br />
<br />
They also asked the users if it was a mistake or if they were curious about a “blank”:<br />
<blockquote>
The average click-through rate across half a million ads served was 0.08%, which would be good for a brand campaign, and so-so for a direct response campaign. We detected no click fraud in the data we counted. Half the clickers told us they were curious, the other half admitted to a mistaken click.</blockquote>
The conclusions are yours to make.
