To update Drupal modules, you need to download manually all modules and this can quickly become tedious. Especially if you have multiple modules and Drupal installations.<br />
<br />
I wrote a simple script that parse the module's page and install or update the most up-to-date version.<br />
<br />
This works for themes as well.&nbsp;To use it, simply go into a modules or themes folder and run one of the tool.<br />
<br />
Valid folders are:<br />
<ul>
<li>/modules</li>
<li>/themes</li>
<li>/sites/all/modules</li>
<li>/sites/all/themes</li>
<li>/sites/*/modules</li>
<li>/sites/*/themes</li>
</ul>
<div>
However, not that you should not try to update root folders, they are&nbsp;reserved for core modules and are updated with Drupal.</div>
<div>
<br />
drupal-install-module.sh will install or update one module,&nbsp;drupal-update-modules.sh will batch update all modules in current folder.<br />
<br /></div>
