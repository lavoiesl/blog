Regular expressions are powerful, yes. They should not be used for everything, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" target="_blank">especially not HTML</a>. HTML is not a regular language. As soon as you need some logic, like checking dates, it is out as well. However, it is tredemously helpful for many things. I suggest <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">regular-expressions.info</a>&nbsp;for a very good round-up and a nice collection.<br />
<br />
Now that you know that you must not use it everywhere, nothing stops you from trying. For example, when using a text editor, you might want to write a simple Regex to match some HTML just to find where it is in all your code, it does not have to be perfect, just good enough. <a href="https://twitter.com/callumacrae" target="_blank">@callumacrae</a>&nbsp;has made a nice website where he posts a challenge every tuesday.&nbsp;http://callumacrae.github.com/regex-tuesday/<br />

Here are my answers so far. They are not perfect, I have taken quite a few shortcuts, but it should get you started.<br />
