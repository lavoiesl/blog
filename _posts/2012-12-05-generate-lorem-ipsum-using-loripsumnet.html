<a href="http://loripsum.net/" target="_blank">loripsum.net</a> describes itself as “The ‘lorem ipsum’ generator that doesn't suck”. It is the same text you are used to see over and over except that it is decorated with various HTML tags like &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, etc.<br />
<br />
Seeing this, I thought it would be nice to use it to generate data fixtures that are meant to be used as blog posts, pages, comments, etc. I started a prototype for Wordpress, I should come up with a post about it soon enough, but in the mean time, I thought it would be valuable to share this little interface.<br />
<br />
It is pretty straight forward and the options are documented in the code itself. Have fun!<br />
