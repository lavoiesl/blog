Starting to build websites can be very hard, keeping up with the technology is a must and building cross-browsers is a daily crisis. A lot of great resources are available to learn, share and experiment but in the end, one must often spend hours to find a way to make exactly what he wants.<br />
<i><br /></i>
<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>correct way</i>&nbsp;is always changing. One of the worst is to embed a video. Do we use a Flash player, a <i>video</i> tag, or both ? Perhaps a javascript fallback on top of it ? What about codecs and fullscreen ? These things always evolve, adjusting with new technology and new hacks that are found.<br />
<br />
Now, giants have decided to do something about it and help us, poor souls. Featuring big companies and big names, here is the launch video of a new wiki called <a href="http://www.webplatform.org/" target="_blank">WebPlatform.org</a>. It is really at an alpha stage, but with all those names on it, they could have as well called it <i>thedocumentation.org</i>.<br />

Also, as a bonus, check out a TED talk from Tim Berners Lee, whom we attribute merely the invention of the World Wide Web:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html</a>
