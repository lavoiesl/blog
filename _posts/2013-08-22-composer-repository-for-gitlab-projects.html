Small script that loops through all branches and tags of all projects in a Gitlab installation
and if it contains a <code>composer.json</code>, adds it to an index.<br />
<br />
This is very similar to the behaviour of Packagist.org<br />
<br />
See <a href="https://github.com/wemakecustom/gitlab-composer/blob/master/examples/packages.json">example</a>.<br />
<h3>
Usage</h3>
Simply include a composer.json in your project, all branches and tags respecting
the <a href="http://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#version">formats for versions</a> will be detected.<br />
<br />
Only requirement is that the package <code>name</code> must be equal to the path of the project. i.e.: <code>my-group/my-project</code>.
This is not a design requirement, it is mostly to prevent common errors when you copy a <code>composer.json</code>
from another project without without changing its name.<br />
<br />
<h3>
Caveats</h3>
While your projects will be protected through SSH, they will be publicly listed.
If you require protection of the package list, <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer/blob/master/doc/articles/handling-private-packages-with-satis.md">I suggest this reading</a>.<br />
