Some javascript libraries are big and they pose a stress on the browser when they are loaded all at the same time.<br />
<br />
Most of these libraries suggest to load them in async.<br />
<h3>
Library examples</h3>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Google Maps</li>
<li>Google Plus</li>
<li>Facebook Like</li>
<li>Twitter button</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Problems with existing solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>A lot of ugly script tag with semi-minified code.</li>
<li>Most of the library suggest the same trick so we see code duplication.</li>
<li>You have to go copy-paste the code each time you start a new project.</li>
<li>If you have multiple libraries, they will all fire at the same time, possibly causing a stress on the browser</li>
<li>While the libraries are loading (usually with a lot of dependencies) the browser is sluggish and users probably want to read that article before clicking on 'Like'.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Solution</h3>
<ul>
<li>Load each library with a function taking an id, a url and a delay.</li>
<li>Allow each library to have a different delay.</li>
<ul>
<li>You may want Google Maps to load only 200ms after the page, but the Facebook Like can wait a bit more.</li>
</ul>
