I was working on a shared hosting project and I noticed the permissions were getting a bit complicated.<br />
<br />
For each website:<br />
<ul>
<li>Each user must have read/write permission</li>
<li>Each user's group must have read/write permission (reseller access)</li>
<li>Apache must have read access</li>
<li>Would be nice if admins had read/write as well</li>
</ul>
<div>
New files can appear at any time, created by all those users, and it would be nice to keep trace of who created them. This is where ACLs kick in.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
For the case above, you need this command:</div>
<div>
<span style="background-color: white; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; white-space: pre;">setfacl -m </span><span class="s1" style="background-color: white; color: #dd1144; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; white-space: pre;">'u:www-data:r-X,g:example-group:rwX,g:sudo:rwX,o::---'</span><span style="background-color: white; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; white-space: pre;"> </span><span class="s2" style="background-color: white; color: #dd1144; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Courier, monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; white-space: pre;">"/srv/www/example.org/htdocs"</span></div>
<h3>
ACLs quirks</h3>
<div>
The problem with ACLs is that they are very fragile and a lot of programs don't propagate them, even if you specify <i>default</i> rules. For example, all programs that <i>move</i>&nbsp;instead of creating will honour the ACL of the directory in which the file was created and the destination. Hence, if you <i>untar</i>&nbsp;the whole website in the directory, the default permissions won't be applied.</div>
<h3>
Running a script</h3>
<div>
You could run a script that will loop through all your websites and force the permissions through a cron, but this is a slow process (around 2 minutes on my current setup with ~10 websites), there is a delay before it will run (15-30 minutes, depending on how you set it up), and it is <i><b>very</b></i> I/O intensive.</div>
<h3>
inotifywait</h3>
<div>
inotify is a library that can warn you if some event occurs on a file or in a folder (recursively). It can be very useful for various tasks like syncing files, doing backups, recording edits progress, etc. inotifywait it simply a program that will wait until the event occurs, so you can execute what you want after.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Watching specifically on CREATE and MOVE events, we can fix the permissions of only the files we need.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
The event ATTRIB (<i>chown, chmod, setfacl</i>) was intentionally left out not to cause loops, but it could probably be worked around.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Included below is an example of watching two folders and the corresponding init script. Tested on Ubuntu.&nbsp;</div>
