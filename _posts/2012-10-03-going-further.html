So, 4 years and a half after having started my bachelor degree at the University of Montreal in <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>, I am done. It has been a long and painful process where I struggled with myself about if I was completing it or not. If I knew what was awaiting me, which is a lot of maths and not a lot of programming, I would have gone elsewhere. Don’t get me wrong, this program is very good —but for people who love optimization, maths,&nbsp;theoretical computer science and quantum computing, which isn’t my strength or&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;my field of interest.&nbsp;I guess it is my fault anyway, I should have checked before.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that it is over, it is time to put it into practice. I worked for 4 years in a mid-size Web company and now I decided to associate myself with a rather new startup and hop in head first. I worked with them for a while as a consultant and they do business the way I like it: great company spirit, nice ideas, will of using the new and open-source technologies and decent business hours. <a href="http://www.wemakecustom.com/" target="_blank">Come and see us</a>!<br />
<br />
I always told myself that a nice work environment where you feel comfortable and continuously challenged is the most important. Hence, I will continue in the same path, sharing the interesting stuff I find while exploring the different Web technologies and trying to make some sense of all this HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/SQL/WTV.<br />
<br />
Also, I finally decided to create myself a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/lavoiesl" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;and a professional <a href="https://twitter.com/lavoie_sl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.<br />
<br />
See you on the Interwebs!
